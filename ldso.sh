# Shared Library Interpreter Trampoline
#
# This script is used to locate a shared library interpreter used to
# run a program. Normally the absolute path to a shared library interpreter
# is embedded in the ELF header and can be displayed using "readelf -l":
#
#  INTERP         0x000134 0x08047134 0x08047134 0x00013 0x00013 R   0x1
#      [Requesting program interpreter: /lib/ld-linux.so.2]
#
# When a turn-key application is packaged, the location of its shared
# libraries is discovered using the $ORIGIN key word in DT_RPATH. This
# script allows the location of the shared library interpreter to be
# discovered using the same mechanism:
#
#  INTERP         0x000154 0x08048154 0x08048154 0x0000e 0x0000e R   0x1
#      [Requesting program interpreter: ld-linux.so.2]
#
# In this case, the shared library interpreter is sought using the
# information embedded in DT_RPATH:
#
# 0x0000000f (RPATH)                      Library rpath: [$ORIGIN/../lib]
#
# The resulting program is run using the discovered shared librar interpreter.
